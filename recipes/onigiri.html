    <p>Onigiri are Japaneses rice balls. They are very popular throughout Japan with hundreds if not thousands of variations. They can be filled with anything you can think of, grilled, topped rolled in furikake, and so on. This recipe will be for plain onigiri.</p>

        <li>Cook the rice according to your rice cooker's instructions.</li>
        <li>Soak your onigiri mold in water to prevent the rice from sticking. Next sprinkle salt onto the mold to season the rice.</li>
